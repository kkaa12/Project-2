# Vanguard New UI Experiment

## Project Overview

This project evaluates the impact of a new User Interface (UI) redesign on Vanguard's digital platform. We analyze client interaction data to assess whether the new UI leads to higher completion rates and a better user experience. Through exploratory data analysis, performance metric evaluation, and hypothesis testing, we determine the effectiveness of the redesign compared to the traditional interface.

## Introduction

The digital landscape is rapidly evolving, necessitating continuous improvements to user interfaces. Vanguard initiated an A/B test to compare the traditional online process with a new, more intuitive UI design. The primary question we sought to answer was: Does the new UI design result in higher completion rates?

## Datasets

- **Client Profiles:** Demographics, account details, and engagement metrics for Vanguard clients.
- **Digital Footprints:** Detailed logs of client interactions with Vanguard's online process.
- **Experiment Roster:** Data indicating whether clients were exposed to the traditional or new UI design.

## Key Findings

1. **Completion Rates:** The new UI design led to a statistically significant increase in process completion rates compared to the traditional design.
2. **User Engagement:** Despite a higher error rate, users spent more time on certain steps in the new UI, suggesting deeper engagement.
3. **Demographic Insights:** The redesign was equally effective across different age groups, with no significant difference in engagement among genders.

## Hypothesis Testing

- **Completion Rate Difference:** Our analysis confirmed that the new UI design significantly improved completion rates, supporting the hypothesis that the redesign enhances the user experience.
- **Cost-Effectiveness Threshold:** Although the new UI increased completion rates, it did not meet Vanguard's minimum threshold for cost-effectiveness, suggesting a need for further optimization.

## Experiment Evaluation

The A/B test was well-structured, ensuring equitable distribution across demographics and minimal biases. The duration of the experiment was adequate for gathering meaningful insights.

## Conclusion

While the new UI design shows promise in enhancing user engagement, its cost-effectiveness remains a concern. Further iterations and tests are recommended to refine the design and maximize its impact.

## Future Work

- **Optimize UI Elements:** Focus on reducing error rates and improving the intuitiveness of the redesign.
- **Longitudinal Study:** Analyze long-term effects of the new UI on client behavior and completion rates.
- **Expand Demographic Analysis:** Investigate the impact of the redesign on different demographic segments to tailor the UI more effectively.
